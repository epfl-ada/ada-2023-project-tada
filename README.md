# Project 2

## Step 1 Download the data and preprocessed embeddings

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python download_data.py
```

The data will be downloaded from a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AO6EznTNmZ0PtBEexL80P9neFcZhSZkT?usp=drive_link)

## Step 2 Add your keys

To fully run the project you will need an OpenAI and a Google Maps key and put them inside the environment variables.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk...'
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY='...'
```
