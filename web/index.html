          <p>
            Welcome to "Uncovering Biases in Cinema," where we embark on a
            cinematic odyssey to investigate the subtle and overt biases that
            shape our understanding of cities, countries, and their histories.
            Our investigation peels back the layers of cinematic storytelling to
            reveal how film can both reflect and distort the reality of our
            world.

        <section id="Our data" class="section">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Our data distribution</h2>
          <p>
            Before delving deep into the analysis we must first take a good look
            at the data. The data we used is the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which
            is a collection of 42,306 movie summaries. We have expanded this
            dataset by using LLMs to generate the locations depicted in the
            story and the characters alignment but also nationality.
          </p>
        
          <br/> <br/>
          <p>
            Our preprocessing only identified 21,000 movies with a country present and around 13,000 with a city present.
            Even with the lower numbers we still have a lot of data to work with.
          </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p> 
                Unsurprisingly, the distribution of movies in countries is not uniform. 
                Most of the movies are from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and India.
                This will be important to keep in mind when analyzing the data and to account for the bias that might be present.

            Stereotypes and Cityscapes in Cinema
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unveiling the canvas of urban landscapes in film, we analyze the
            interplay of genre and geography. Does cinema pigeonhole cities into
            certain thematic roles? We dissect the patterns of representation
            that have come to define the cinematic identities of places like
            Paris and New York.

            Rewriting History Through the Camera Lens
          </h2>
          <p>
            How does cinema choose to remember—or forget—historical events? This
            segment explores the selective lens through which films narrate
            history, comparing their retellings with the annals of actual
            events.

            Cultural Origins and Their Impact on Film Narrative
          </h2>
          <p>
            The origin of a film often colors its narrative. Here we delve into
            how a movie's homeland influences its portrayal of friends and foes,
            and what this reveals about national self-perception and otherness.

            Temporal Contexts in Cinema
          </h2>
          <p>
            In this section, we travel through time with cinema, examining how
            different eras have distinct cinematic signatures. We ponder whether
            the era in which a film is made influences its portrayal of certain
            cities, countries, and events.

            Characterizing Villains: A Cross-Cultural Examination
          </h2>
          <p>
            Villains often carry the weight of cultural stereotypes. We
            scrutinize how different cultures, from Eastern Europe to Hollywood,
            craft their cinematic villains and what implications this has on
            global perceptions.

            Is there a correlation between the geographical setting of a film
            and its critical acclaim or box office success? We analyze data to
            determine if the backdrop of a story influences its reception and
            ratings.

            Our final analytical lens focuses on the depiction of human
            characteristics such as names, occupations, and demographics. How
            well does cinema mirror the rich tapestry of human diversity?

            As our cinematic journey concludes, we reflect on the power of film
            to influence, inform, and inspire. Our findings offer a mosaic of
            insights into how cinema, across eras and origins, crafts our
            collective consciousness. By understanding these biases, we become
            more informed viewers, able to discern the line where art diverges
            from reality, and appreciate the stories told within their
            historical and cultural context. Also Tanguy rocksss
