            Welcome to "How does cinema view the world?", a data visualization
            journey through the cinematic world. In this project we will explore
            how cinema portrays the world and how this has changed over time.
            <br />
            <br />
            We aim to uncover the biases with respect to the portrayal of
            countries, cities, and characters in movies. We will also look at
            how these biases have changed over time and how they differ between
            countries.

        <section id="large" class="section">
          <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-3">Large scale analysis</h1>
          <p>
            Before delving deep into the analysis we must first take a good look
            at the data. The data we used is the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, which
            is a collection of 42,306 movie summaries. We have expanded this
            dataset by using LLMs(OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo model) to generate the locations depicted in the
            story and the characters alignment but also nationality.
          </p>
        
          <br/> <br/>
          <p>
            Our preprocessing only identified 21,000 movies with a country present and around 13,000 with a city present.
            Even with the lower numbers we still have a lot of data to work with.
          </p>

            <br/> <br/>

            <p> 
                Unsurprisingly, the distribution of movies in countries is not uniform. 
                Most of the movies are from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and India.
                This will be important to keep in mind when analyzing the data and to account for the bias that might be present.

            <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Going into vector space</h1>
            <p>
                In order to be able to easily extract meaning from movie summaries a common technique is to use embeddings.
                Embeddings are a way to represent pieces of text as vectors, where meaning is encoded in the distance between vectors.
                We used the OpenAI Ada2 model to generate embeddings for our movie summaries.
                <br/> <br/>
                <img src="plots/embedding.png" alt="Embedding" width="100%" height="500px"></img>
                We have done this for the movie summaries in order to be able to quantify the similarity between movies
                and to extract clusters of movies. We can then use these clusters to see how the movies are distributed across countries
                and notice shifts in the distribution over time and similarities between countries.
                <br/> <br/>
                For a global view of the embeddings we used T-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings to 2 dimensions which allows us to easily visualize the embeddings.
                <iframe src="plots/tsne.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
                By playing around with the search terms we can see that the embeddings do capture some meaning and some clusters can be identified.
                <br/> <br/>
                We are even able to observe some clusters for specific movie countries.
                <iframe src="plots/tsne_countries.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
                Some particular countries are interesting to look at.
                For example, for Germany we can see a cluster that is very close to the cluster of war movies from before and
                France has a close cluster to movies about Love but also a cluster of movies about war.
                <br/> <br/>
                We can also observe that countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have no clear clusters
                and are more spread out across the plot showing that they are portrayed in many different ways as opposed to other countries 
                such as Vietnam where most movies are concentrated in a single cluster.

            <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Genre analysis</h1>

            <p>
              As part of the CMU Movie Summary Corpus we have all the genres for each movie.
              We can use this to see how the genres are distributed across countries.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-3">Cityscapes</h2>
          <p>
            Cities are a central part of many movies. They are often used as a
            backdrop for the story and can even be a character in their own
            right. We will look at how cities are portrayed in movies and what
            biases are present.

          <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">IMDb ratings</h1>
            <p>
              In this section we analyze IMDb ratings of different cities. Our focus is on cities that feature in the plot of at least 50 movies.

          <p>
            Characters are the heart of any story. They are the ones that
            drive the plot forward and make us care about the story. We will
            look at how characters are portrayed in movies and what biases are
            present.

          <p>
            Movies are a reflection of the time they were made in. They are
            influenced by the culture and events of the time. We will look at
            how movies have changed over time and what biases are present.

          <p>
            As our cinematic journey concludes, we reflect on the power of film
            to influence, inform, and inspire. Our findings offer a mosaic of
            insights into how cinema, across eras and origins, crafts our
            collective consciousness. By understanding these biases, we become
            more informed viewers, able to discern the line where art diverges
            from reality, and appreciate the stories told within their
            historical and cultural context. Also Tanguy rocksss
